    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 border-b pb-2">Chapter 1: An Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The advent of high-throughput technologies in biology has ushered in an era of unprecedented data generation. Fields like genomics, proteomics, and high-content imaging produce vast and complex datasets that hold the keys to understanding biological systems, diagnosing diseases, and developing novel therapeutics. However, the sheer scale and dimensionality of this data make it impossible to analyze using traditional methods alone.</p>
    <p>Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable tool in the modern biologist's toolkit. It provides a powerful framework for building models that can learn from data, identify subtle patterns, make predictions, and ultimately, turn massive datasets into actionable biological insights.</p>

<div class="content-section">
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">A New Paradigm: Learning from Data</h3>
    <p>Traditional programming requires a human to explicitly define a set of rules for the computer to follow. This approach is effective for well-defined problems, such as calculating sequence alignment scores or parsing a FASTA file. However, for many complex biological questionsâ€”such as predicting a protein's function from its sequence or identifying cancerous cells from an imageâ€”the underlying rules are either unknown or too complex to articulate.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Machine Learning inverts this paradigm. Instead of providing the rules, we provide the data and the desired outcomes. The algorithm's task is to learn the rules that map the input data to those outcomes.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Paradigms of Machine Learning</h3>
    <p class="mb-6">Machine learning algorithms are typically categorized into three main paradigms, distinguished by the type of data they use and the learning strategy they employ.</p>

    <!-- Supervised Learning Section -->
    <h4 id="supervised" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3 pt-6 mt-8 border-t scroll-mt-20">Supervised Learning</h4>
    <p>In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a dataset where each data point is accompanied by a correct label or target value. The goal is to learn a general mapping function that can accurately predict the label for new, unseen data.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight my-4">
        <strong>Analogy:</strong> Supervised learning is analogous to a student learning with a set of practice problems that have a corresponding answer key. By studying the problems and their solutions, the student learns the general principles needed to solve new problems on the final exam.
    </div>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Classification Tasks</h5>
    <p>The goal is to predict a discrete categorical label.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Predicting whether a DNA sequence contains a promoter region (Class 1) or not (Class 0) based on k-mer frequencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Classifying a tumor sample as one of several subtypes (e.g., Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched) based on its gene expression profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Regression Tasks</h5>
    <p>The goal is to predict a continuous numerical value.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Predicting the binding affinity of a drug candidate to a target protein based on its molecular descriptors.</li>
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Modeling the expression level of a gene based on the methylation status of its promoter.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Unsupervised Learning Section -->
    <h4 id="unsupervised" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3 pt-6 mt-8 border-t scroll-mt-20">Unsupervised Learning</h4>
    <p>In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given a dataset without any labels. Its task is to find inherent structures, patterns, or relationships within the data on its own.</p>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Clustering</h5>
    <p>The algorithm groups similar data points together.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Grouping genes with similar expression patterns across different conditions, which may suggest they are co-regulated or part of the same biological pathway.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Dimensionality Reduction</h5>
    <p>The algorithm reduces the number of features in a dataset while preserving its important structural information. This is crucial for visualizing high-dimensional data.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Bioinformatics Example:</strong> Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to visualize single-cell RNA-sequencing data, allowing researchers to identify distinct cell populations in a 2D or 3D plot.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!-- Reinforcement Learning Section -->
    <h4 id="reinforcement" class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-3 pt-6 mt-8 border-t scroll-mt-20">Reinforcement Learning</h4>
    <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent that learns to make a sequence of decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. While less common in bioinformatics than supervised or unsupervised learning, RL is an emerging area with exciting applications in problems like de novo drug design and optimizing experimental protocols.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle</h3>
    <p>A successful machine learning project follows a structured, iterative process:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
        <li><strong>Data Collection and Pre-processing:</strong> Gathering and cleaning the raw data. This is often the most time-consuming step.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering and Selection:</strong> Creating meaningful input variables (features) from the data and selecting the most relevant ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Choosing an appropriate algorithm for the task (e.g., linear regression, decision tree).</li>
        <li><strong>Training:</strong> Fitting the model to a portion of the data (the training set).</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the model's performance on a separate, unseen portion of the data (the test set).</li>
        <li><strong>Tuning and Deployment:</strong> Iteratively adjusting model parameters to improve performance and finally deploying the model for use.</li>
    </ol>
